# SEP Reference

`sep-reference` is a spec-first reference package for Stellar Ecosystem Proposals (SEPs) focused on anchor services.

This workspace contains:
- Machine-readable specifications for SEP-10 and SEP-24
- Shared schemas and test vectors
- A Go reference server with SEP-1, SEP-10, and SEP-24 endpoints
- Compliance and traceability artifacts that map SEP requirements to tests

## Quick Start

```bash
cd reference/go
cp .env.example .env
go run ./cmd/server
```

## Compliance Workflow

```bash
make test
make compliance-sep10
make compliance-sep24
```

## Normative Source

Official SEP specs are in the Stellar protocol repository:
- https://github.com/stellar/stellar-protocol/tree/master/ecosystem

For requirement mapping, see:
- `specs/traceability/sep1-sep10-matrix.md`
- `specs/traceability/sep24-matrix.md`
